# 🌯 emeal-server

This is a minimal webapplication to function as a proxy between anything requiring meal data (e.g. your app, etc.) and the [canteen menu](https://www.studentenwerk-dresden.de/mensen/speiseplan/) of the Studentwerk Dresden. It's powered by [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) and runs on Swift.

At the current time this is very much still a work in progress.
